{"name":"Reddittray","tagline":"Reddit Tray is a minimalist Reddit app for Linux","body":"RedditTray\r\n==========\r\n\r\nRedditTray is a simple [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/python) Linux application\r\nthat lets you view /r/python links in your System Tray. It currently supports python only \r\nhowever I will add an option to add other subreddits as well It relies on appindicator, so\r\nit is not guaranteed to work on all systems. It also provides a Gtk StatusIcon fallback\r\nin case AppIndicator is not available.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this came from [hackertray](https://github.com/captn3m0/hackertray), which is \r\nfor Hacker news. I just ported that code for reddit.\r\n\r\n##Screenshot\r\n\r\n![RedditTray Screenshot in Ubuntu](http://i.imgur.com/gzIXbzW.png)\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nRedditTray is distributed as a python package. Do the following to install:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\nsudo pip install reddittray\r\nOR\r\nsudo easy_install reddittray\r\nOR\r\n#Download Source and cd to it\r\nsudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, you can run `reddittray` from anywhere and it will run. You can\r\nnow add it to your OS dependent session autostart method. In Ubuntu, you can\r\naccess it via: \r\n\r\n1. System > Preferences > Sessions  \r\n(OR)\r\n2. System > Preferences > Startup Applications \r\n\r\ndepending on your Ubuntu Version. Or put it in `~/.config/openbox/autostart` \r\nif you are running OpenBox. \r\n\r\n###Upgrade\r\nThe latest stable version is always the one [available on pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reddittray/).\r\nYou can check which version you have installed with `pip freeze | grep reddittray`.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade, run `pip install -U reddittray`. In some cases (Ubuntu), you might\r\nneed to clear the pip cache before upgrading:\r\n\r\n`sudo rm -rf /tmp/pip-build-root/reddittray`\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n1. Minimalist Approach to Reddit\r\n2. Opens links in your default browser\r\n3. Remembers which links you opened\r\n4. Shows Points/Comment count in a simple format\r\n\r\n##To-Do\r\n- Auto Start\r\n- Try to convert right click to reddit link\r\n\r\n##Author Information\r\n- Muhammad Yasoob Khalid (<yasoob.khld@gmail.com>)\r\n\r\n##Licence\r\nLicenced under the MIT Licence","google":"UA-46059954-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
