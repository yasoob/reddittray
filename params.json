{"name":"Hackertray","tagline":"Hacker Tray is a minimalist Hacker News app for Linux","body":"HackerTray\r\n==========\r\n\r\nHackerTray is a simple [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) Linux application\r\nthat lets you view top HN stories in your System Tray. It relies on appindicator, so\r\nit is not guaranteed to work on all systems. It also provides a Gtk StatusIcon fallback\r\nin case AppIndicator is not available.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this came from [Hacker Bar](http://hackerbarapp.com), which is \r\nMac-only. I tried to port it to `node-webkit`, but had to do it in Python instead\r\nbecause nw doesn't support AppIndicators yet.\r\n\r\n##Screenshot\r\n\r\n![HackerTray Screenshot in elementaryOS](http://i.imgur.com/63l3qXV.png)\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nHackerTray is distributed as a python package. Do the following to install:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\nsudo pip install hackertray\r\nOR\r\nsudo easy_install hackertray\r\nOR\r\n#Download Source and cd to it\r\nsudo setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, you can run `hackertray` from anywhere and it will run. You can\r\nnow add it to your OS dependent session autostart method. In Ubuntu, you can\r\naccess it via: \r\n\r\n1. System > Preferences > Sessions  \r\n(OR)\r\n2. System > Preferences > Startup Applications \r\n\r\ndepending on your Ubuntu Version. Or put it in `~/.config/openbox/autostart` \r\nif you are running OpenBox. [Here](http://imgur.com/mnhIzDK) is how the \r\nconfiguration should look like in Ubuntu and its derivatives.\r\n\r\n###Upgrade\r\nThe latest stable version is always the one [available on pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hackertray/).\r\nYou can check which version you have installed with `pip freeze | grep hackertray`.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade, run `pip install -U hackertray`. In some cases (Ubuntu), you might\r\nneed to clear the pip cache before upgrading:\r\n\r\n`sudo rm -rf /tmp/pip-build-root/hackertray`\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n1. Minimalist Approach to HN\r\n2. Opens links in your default browser\r\n3. Remembers which links you opened\r\n4. Shows Points/Comment count in a simple format\r\n\r\n##To-Do\r\n- Auto Start\r\n- Try to convert right click to comments link\r\n\r\n##Author Information\r\n- Abhay Rana (<me@captnemo.in>)\r\n\r\n## Donating\r\nSupport this project and [others by captn3m0][gittip] via [gittip][].\r\n\r\n[![Support via Gittip][gittip-badge]][gittip]\r\n\r\n[gittip-badge]: https://rawgithub.com/twolfson/gittip-badge/master/dist/gittip.png\r\n[gittip]: https://www.gittip.com/captn3m0/\r\n\r\n##Licence\r\nLicenced under the MIT Licence","google":"UA-5922129-12","note":"Don't delete this file!
